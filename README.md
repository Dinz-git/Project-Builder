  - Generate project files for MSVC or MinGW
- Clean scripts to:
  - Remove generated files
  - Remove downloaded dependencies

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

## üì¶ Requirements

- Git  
- Curl and Tar  
- C++ Compiler (MSVC or MinGW)

## üîÆ What's Next

- [ ] Refactor and split logic into modular files  
- [ ] Allow adding any library, not just Enet or Raylib  
- [ ] Add support for saving custom `premake5.lua` for external libraries  
- [ ] Add support for Linux (build scripts and environment)
